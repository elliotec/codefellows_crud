This is the Code Fellows code challenge sample Rails app- "Generate a Rails app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. *  
Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. First name is required. Email should be a valid email. Deploy this app to Heroku (a free *.herokuapp.com URL) so we can test it out live. If you breezed through this challenge, add extra features to this app (be creative)."
